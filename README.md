What is  Parallalax Effect?
Parallax scrolling is a technique in computer graphics where background images move past the camera more slowly than foreground images, creating an illusion of depth in a 2D scene of distance. It is a difference in the apparent position of an object when viewed along two different lines of sight.

Creating a parallax effect website using HTML and CSS is a popular way to add depth and create a visually engaging experience. Parallax scrolling involves background images moving at a different speed than the foreground content, giving a sense of motion as the user scrolls.

To create a parallax effect website:

- HTML Structure: Organize your page with multiple sections. Some will have a parallax background, while others will have static content.

- CSS Parallax: Apply background-attachment: fixed; to the background images in the parallax sections. This makes the background stay in place while the content scrolls, creating the parallax effect.

- Mobile Consideration: Parallax effects can be less effective on mobile, so you may want to disable them or use fallbacks for smaller screens.

- Performance: Optimize images and limit the use of parallax to avoid slowing down your website.

- Enhancement: You can use CSS animations or JavaScript to add more interactivity or control over the scrolling speed.
