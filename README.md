What is  Parallalax Effect?
Parallax scrolling is a technique in computer graphics where background images move past the camera more slowly than foreground images, creating an illusion of depth in a 2D scene of distance. It is a difference in the apparent position of an object when viewed along two different lines of sight.

Creating a parallax effect website using HTML and CSS is a popular way to add depth and create a visually engaging experience. Parallax scrolling involves background images moving at a different speed than the foreground content, giving a sense of motion as the user scrolls.
